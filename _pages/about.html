    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I’m an ambitious digital product designer with a passion for creating simple and elegant solutions to complex problems.
    As an advocate of open, inclusive design, I believe that the best design is that which works for everyone.</p>

    <p>For more than 8 years, I have helped develop industry leading digital services for companies across a variety of
    sectors.</p>

    <p>When I’m not working, I enjoy long walks with my dog, playing football, going to the cinema and relaxing with a good
    book.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to talk about how I could help your company, please don’t hesitate to get in touch: <a href="mailto:hello@greatscott.design">hello@greatscott.design</a>.</p>
