    <p>The Arnold Clark homepage had served as a starting point for thousands of customers each month looking for a new car.
    The search mechanic had remained largely unchanged for several years and was looking and feeling dated compared to
    similar search products on the market. Furthermore, there were several aspects of the design which were underperforming
    and even proving to be a barrier to customers looking to find a new car.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>There were several goals we wished to achieve with a redesign including:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Bring Arnold Clark's home page search feature inline with other contemporary, industry leading, search products.</li>
      <li>Reduce how much information is required up front while still providing meaningful search results for prospective
      customers.</li>
      <li>Create a space which could be utilised for marketing campaigns and social proof.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Investigation</h2>
    <p>Throughout the project, we called upon a number of methods to analyse the existing solution and determine what we might
    do to improve the user experience. These included, analysing sales data and analytics as well as scenario based user
    testing and taking inspiration from industry leading companies.</p>
    
    <h3>Data analysis</h3>
    <p>The most crucial element of the redesign was establishing how much information was required from the user up-front to
    generate meaningful search results.</p>
    <p>Analytical data showed that users most commonly interacted with the Make, Model and Price fields. In contrast, users
    engaged with the “Postcode”, “Distance” and “Cars with images only” fields infrequently. This was backed up in scenario
    based user testing where participants were often confused by why they were having to provide their postcode to see
    vehicles.</p>
    <p>Additionally, insights from sales data helped us identify that the majority of sales stemmed from PCP and Hire Purchase
    finance deals. These insights led us to consider whether defaulting the search to “Monthly payments” instead of “Cash
    price” might yield more relevant results for users.</p>

    <h3>User testing</h3>
    <p>A number of scenario based user testing sessions were conducted with real Arnold Clark customers during branch visits.
    These tests asked customers to imagine a scenario where they had a set budget and to find a car that met their needs.</p>
    <p>User testing helped us identify that while in the majority of cases, prospective customers did not know exactly which
    make and model of vehicle they were looking for; they did have a good idea of their budget. This was unknowingly proving
    to be a potentially costly issue for both the company and the prospective customer.</p>
    <p>We found that the customers' budget often influenced which option they selected in the “Show me” field, with many opting
    to select “Used cars” thinking their budget would not allow for new or nearly-new vehicles. This unwittingly resulted in
    customers missing out on new (often better specced) vehicles as they believed they could not afford them.</p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Inspiration was gathered from a number of sources, chiefly, from companies who were (at the time) renowned for industry
    leading search products including: Airbnb, Skyscanner, Rightmove and Booking.com.</p>

    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <p>Armed with a wealth of statistical information, user insights and industry inspiration, we could begin to envisage how
    the new Arnold Clark search would look and work. These changes included:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Remove the “Show me” option which we believed was setting costly misconceptions.</li>
      <li>Change the default search from “cash price” to “pay monthly”.</li>
      <li>Replace the sluggish payment UI slider with “Minimum” and “Maximum” select options.</li>
      <li>Remove the confusing and infrequently used “Postcode”, “Distance”, and “Cars with images only” fields.</li>
      <li>Redesign the component to be more inline with industry leading examples.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>The final proposal was subject to an A/B test to identify any significant statistical change in data such as:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Results page visits from home page search.</li>
      <li>Results page filtering (were users actively engaging with some of the options which we had changed/removed from the original design?).</li>
      <li>Enquiry levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Over the course of the two week test period, the new design out-performed the control across the board. Increased number
    of visitors to the home page performed a search and fewer people were engaging with the price filter on the search
    results screen (changing it back to cash). Enquiry levels were also trending slightly above the control group although
    not by a statistically significant level.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the redesigned header section was met with much enthusiasm from the marketing department who realised the
    potential to publicise ad campaigns in the new real estate.</p>
